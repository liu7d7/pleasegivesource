### About
Hey, I'm Ethius, a self taught java developer. I think putting pronouns here is cringe. I like to work on Minecraft clients and stupid stuff. If you need to contact me hit up my discord Ethius#5699. My main goal for 2021 is to get good.

### Current Project
* Quantum: Private custom base 1.16 fabric client.
* SalHackSkid: Salhack skid for highways, somehow got picked up by IIS or something it wasn't even designed for 2b2t but it also used to be called clean miner and somehow I still have the jar from when it _was_ called clean miner idk what i'm even typing at this point.

### Software
* IDE: IntelliJ IDEA.
* OS: Windows 10/7/XP.
